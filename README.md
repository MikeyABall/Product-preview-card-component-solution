## My process

Started with semantic HTML and then setup my CSS.
Matched the design for mobile and then added some media queries to get it to fit desktop better.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some new semantic elements for HTML to improve accessibility. I also used data tags to manipulate images easier from different screen sizes and icon in the button element.
